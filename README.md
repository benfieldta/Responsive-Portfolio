# Responsive-Portfolio
Responsive portfolio adding media queries

This is my personal portfolio. It was built with only HTML and CSS. I am adding projects that I work on to the portfolio
section for users to view. It is hosted on Github currently. Once I have a few more projects on there and am able to commit
some time to adding some JS for added functionality, I plan on standing it up on Heroku.
